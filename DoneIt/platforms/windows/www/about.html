 				<h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm DoneIt, a simple task tracking app with group functionality.</p>
                <p>My designers created me with one simple idea in mind, to create a user-friendly app that people could use to assist them, their family, and friends in managing their busy lives.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Terms to know</h3>
                <p>A "DoneIt" is a task.</p>
                <p>A "Group" is anyone with which you would like to share and complete tasks.</p>
